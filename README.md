## 📌 Executive Summary & Problem Statement

At university campuses, commuter students and hostel residents frequently need to coordinate shared cabs, airport shuttles, and inter-city travel (e.g. Srinagar &harr; Jammu / Airport / Railway Station). Traditionally, these requests were posted across dozens of cluttered, ephemeral WhatsApp groups where ride requests were quickly buried, timings were missed, and safety accountability was virtually non-existent.

**COORDINATE** solves this as a dedicated, real-time public digital utility:
1. **Physical Root of Trust & Early Launch Agility:** Accounts are verified in person against physical student ID cards, with a built-in `--early-launch` toggle for instant self-declaration during high-demand end-of-term departure rushes.
2. **Mutual Physical Accountability:** Anonymity is strictly prohibited inside moving vehicles. Confirmed co-passengers mutually share verified identities and pickup phone numbers.
3. **Real-Time Coordination:** ASGI WebSockets deliver instant ride chat, waitlist promotions, occupancy density curves, and departure synchronization.
4. **Institutional Security:** Cryptographic HMAC-SHA256 dual-channel OTPs, FIDO2/WebAuthn biometric passkeys, rate-limited reputation anti-farming, and single active session controls.
5. **Multi-Client Ready:** Complete dual support for both Web (Django Templates + HTMX) and Mobile (React Native Android via Bearer Token REST & WebSocket APIs with full CORS support).

## 🚀 Key Features & Engineering Highlights

### 1. In-Person Physical Root of Trust & Verification Desk
* Rather than relying solely on automated digital self-assertion, the platform anchors digital trust to physical reality.
* Students apply with their official enrollment number (`YYYY[BMP][BRANCH][ROLL]`) and phone number, verify inbox ownership via a 6-digit email OTP, and present their physical Institute ID card at the campus verification desk.
* Authorized student administrators review and approve accounts directly via the `/operations/` console.

### 2. Early Launch Mode (`--early-launch`) & Temporary Database Isolation
* During end-of-term transit surges when in-person desk verification creates an onboarding bottleneck, the system can be started with the `--early-launch` CLI flag or `EARLY_LAUNCH_MODE=True`.
* **Isolated Temporary Database:** All early access self-declarations, rides, and chats are written to `temp_early_access.sqlite3`. The permanent database is never touched, completely eliminating data corruption or conflicts with real accounts.
* **Untrusted Status (`verified=False`):** Self-declared accounts are explicitly marked untrusted, badged in profiles and rosters, and temporary.
* **Purgeable & Reversible:** Omitting `--early-launch` restores the pristine permanent database. Run `python manage.py purge_early_launch` to purge the temporary database post-rush.

### 3. Dynamic Ride Capacity Modification & Surplus Ejection
* Hosts can adjust total vehicle capacity post-creation (`1 <= total_spots <= 6`).
* When decreasing capacity below current passenger count, hosts must explicitly select which surplus passenger(s) to remove, preventing arbitrary or unhandled drops while automatically recalibrating waitlists.

### 4. Theme-Synchronized Canvas Favicon Engine
* Tab favicons dynamically re-render on an HTML5 `<canvas>` in real-time, matching the active user colorway (Emerald, Cyan, Indigo, Amber, Rose, etc.) or custom hex values.
* Fallback 32x32 PNG endpoint served at `/favicon.ico` with HTTP 200 OK.

### 5. Interactive Database Setup & Management Script
* Built-in interactive setup utility: `python setup.py` (or `python manage.py setup_db`).
* Interactive migration runner that prompts before applying schema updates.
* Full menu-driven database inspector: browse tables, execute DQL (`SELECT`), execute transactional DML/DDL (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`), and view real-time diagnostics.
* Abstracted User Provisioning: create Superuser Admins, Staff, or Standard Students directly in PostgreSQL or SQLite with automatic enrollment parsing and password hashing.

### 6. Physical Ride Accountability & Audience Comfort
* **No Anonymous Riders IRL:** Inside a shared motor vehicle, passengers and host mutually view each other's verified student name, enrollment, and contact number with one-click call and WhatsApp integration.
* **Spectator Privacy:** Browsing students outside the ride see aggregate occupancy counts without access to passenger rosters or private phone numbers.
* **Audience Comfort Settings:** Ride hosts can specify comfort preferences: `MIXED`, `BOYS`, `GIRLS`, or `FRIENDS`-only.
* **Non-Destructive Soft Cancellation:** When all participants leave an active ride, the platform sets `status = 'CANCELLED'` rather than deleting database rows, permanently preserving safety incident reports, grievance histories, and audit evidence.

### 7. Anti-Farming Reliability Reputation Engine
* Every completed group commute increments a student's `rides_completed` counter.
* To prevent collusion and reputation score farming on a public utility, on-time reliability score boosts (`on_time_count`) are mathematically capped at **3 boosts per 15-day rolling window** per user.
* Enforced by database check constraint: `1 <= total_spots <= 6`.

### 8. FIDO2 / WebAuthn Biometric Passkeys & Mobile Token Parity
* WebAuthn standard implementation allowing students to register and sign in with hardware security keys, Touch ID, Apple Face ID, or Windows Hello biometrics.
* React Native Android clients authenticate using Bearer session tokens with full WebSocket parity.

## 1. Critical & High Priority (P0 / P1)

| ID | Sev | Investigation Target | Code Evidence / Analysis | Current Status | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEC-01** | P0 | Private complaint text exposed on public profiles | Private complaint text restricted to authorized staff/moderators; sanitized from regular student profiles. | **FIXED** | 2 |
| **SEC-02** | P0 | Phone numbers exposed to unentitled users | Phone numbers restricted by explicit `can_view_phone_number` policy (self, friends, host/passenger during ride); hidden from unrelated co-passengers. | **FIXED** | 2 |
| **SEC-03** | P0 | Gender-restricted ride creator eligibility not enforced | Server-side creator gender checks enforced in `create_ride`: female for GIRLS, male for BOYS. | **FIXED** | 2–3 |
| **SEC-04** | P0 | Removed/kicked participant retains WebSocket access or rejoins | Kicked passengers stored in `kicked_users` M2M and blocked from rejoining; WebSocket dynamically closes if membership revoked. | **FIXED** | 3–4 |
| **SEC-05** | P0 | Password handling in account creation / reset | Standard `PasswordChangeView` / `PasswordChangeDoneView` wired; `UserAdmin` upgraded to `BaseUserAdmin` for secure admin password management. | **FIXED** | 2 |
| **SEC-06** | P0 | Authentication / application brute-force & enumeration | Cache-backed `rate_limit` decorator applied to `apply_account` and authentication paths; returns 429 upon limit breach. | **FIXED** | 2 |
| **SEC-07** | P0 | Development credentials in repository / documentation | `debug_accounts.md` untracked from Git and added to `.gitignore`. Plaintext password removed from `create_debug_accounts.py` stdout. | **FIXED** | 1 |
| **SEC-08** | P0 | Destructive reset / debug command runnable in production | Added `if not settings.DEBUG:` guard to `create_debug_accounts.py` raising `CommandError`. Refuses in production. | **FIXED** | 1 |
| **SEC-09** | P0 | Production configuration fallback to unsafe defaults | `campus/settings/prod.py` raises `ValueError` if `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` is missing or matches placeholder. | **FIXED** | 1, 8 |
| **DATA-01** | P0/P1 | Completed rides hard-deleted, losing history | Terminating or leaving a ride with messages preserves it with status `CANCELLED` instead of hard deleting. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **DATA-02** | P0/P1 | Concurrent joins exceeding capacity or one-active-ride | `coordinate/views.py:join_ride` uses `select_for_update()` inside `transaction.atomic()`, checking capacity before creating `RideParticipant`. Race condition is mitigated, but concurrency tests against PostgreSQL must be added to verify invariant under load. | **ALREADY FIXED** (needs PG test) | 3 |
| **DATA-03** | P1 | Duplicate review / completion / attendance operations | Reviews enforce rating range 1-5, disallow self-review; completion updates are idempotent. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **AUTH-01** | P1 | Enrollment number case normalization | `EnrollmentBackend` and `EnrollmentAuthenticationForm` normalize usernames/enrollments to uppercase; `AccountApplicationForm` validates and normalizes. | **FIXED** | 2 |
| **AUTH-02** | P1 | Application queue lacks rejection & malformed handling | Added `reject_application` view (POST only, superuser gated, atomic, HTMX support), UI reject action, and form regex validation. | **FIXED** | 2 |
| **RIDE-01** | P1 | Past or malformed departure time accepted | `RideRequestForm.clean_departure_time` requires future time and rejects dates beyond 30-day horizon. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **RIDE-02** | P1 | Expired/past rides lock users indefinitely | `_user_has_active_ride` ignores rides past departure + 2-hour buffer; users can create/join new rides. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **RIDE-03** | P1 | Ride history unreachable through navigation | Created `/coordinate/my-rides/` dedicated history interface with active, past, and created rides. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **RIDE-04** | P1 | Kicked participant can rejoin same ride | Added `ride.kicked_users` tracking and blocked kicked users from joining in `_user_can_join_ride`. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **RIDE-05** | P1 | Reliability / attendance counters not updated | `complete_ride` increments `rides_completed` and `on_time_count` atomically for all participants. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **DEP-01** | P1 | Deployment TLS/proxy/CSRF/host settings unsafe | `campus/settings/prod.py` configured with `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`, `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, strict cookie flags, and `/health/` healthcheck endpoint. | **FIXED** | 8 |
| **DEP-02** | P1 | Container build context leaks local files / secrets | `.dockerignore` created with explicit exclusions for `.env`, `.git`, `db.sqlite3`, `debug_accounts.md`, `venv/`, etc. | **FIXED** | 1, 8 |
| **DEP-03** | P1 | WebSocket/ASGI deployment unverified | Channels is configured with `InMemoryChannelLayer` in `dev.py`. In `base.py`, Redis channel layer is configured via `REDIS_URL`. Integration tests using a shared channel layer are missing. | **CONFIRMED** | 4, 8 |

| ID | Sev | Investigation Target | Code Evidence / Analysis | Current Status | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **APP-01** | P2 | Incoming friend requests visibility and actions | Added `decline_friend_request` view (POST only) and cleaned up friendship state. | **FIXED** | 4 |
| **APP-02** | P2 | Friendship records duplicated in reciprocal order | Enforced canonical `user1_id < user2_id` ordering in `Friendship.save()`, eliminating reciprocal duplicates. | **FIXED** | 4 |

| **UI-01** | P2 | Rating form displays blank choice | `RideReviewForm` uses explicit `ChoiceField` with values 1-5 and no empty choice. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **UI-02** | P2 | HTMX approval response contract | In `accounts/views.py:approve_application`, if `request.htmx`, returns empty `HttpResponse('')`. Works with `hx-swap="outerHTML"`, but non-HTMX returns redirect. | **ALREADY FIXED** | 4 |
| **UI-03** | P2 | HTMX unused fragments / dead handlers | In `coordinate/views.py`, `join_ride` and `leave_ride` return `ride_actions.html` on `request.htmx`, but template form did not include `hx-post` attributes in `ride_list.html`. | **CONFIRMED** | 4 |
| **FILTER-01** | P2 | Invalid date/time query params crash | `coordinate/views.py` uses `_parse_date` and `_parse_time` with try-except fallback to `timezone.now().date()` and `None`. | **ALREADY FIXED** | 3 |
| **FILTER-02** | P2 | Date navigation boundary & past dates | Date navigation strip restricted to today + next 6 days; past dates cannot be clicked. | **FIXED** | 3 |

| **TIME-01** | P2 | Date boundary around UTC/Asia-Kolkata | `TIME_ZONE = 'Asia/Kolkata'` and `USE_TZ = True` set in `base.py`. `timezone.now().date()` evaluated in local timezone. | **ALREADY FIXED** | 3 |
| **ADMIN-01** | P2 | Admin user model setup & custom password | Upgraded `UserAdmin` to inherit from `django.contrib.auth.admin.UserAdmin` with full fieldsets and secure password hashing forms. | **FIXED** | 2, 7 |
| **ADMIN-02** | P2 | Application approval atomicity | `approve_application` in `accounts/views.py` is wrapped in `transaction.atomic()`. | **ALREADY FIXED** | 2 |
| **METRIC-01** | P2 | Reliability counter race conditions | `complete_ride` and `review_user` atomically update `rides_completed`, `on_time_count`, `late_count`, and `no_show_count` using atomic `F()` expressions. | **FIXED** | 3 |
| **STATIC-01** | P2 | Static file config & WhiteNoise | `whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware` configured. Warning on missing `staticfiles/` dir before `collectstatic`. | **ALREADY FIXED** | 8 |
| **CDN-01** | P2 | Third-party CDN integrity controls | Added verified Subresource Integrity (`integrity="sha384-..."`) and `crossorigin="anonymous"` to Bootstrap 5.3.3, Bootstrap Icons, and HTMX 1.9.12 in `templates/base.html`. | **FIXED** | 5 |
| **DUMP-01** | P2 | Project dump utility exports sensitive files | `dump_project.py` rewritten with `EXCLUDED_FILES` and `EXCLUDED_DIRS` to block secrets, credentials, and local databases. | **FIXED** | 1 |
| **API-01** | P2 | Web vs API parity | Versioned REST API (`/api/v1/`) implemented with parity across auth, catalogue, user profile, ride discovery, creation, join, leave, and history. | **FIXED** | 6 |

| **EXPORT-01** | P2 | Data export features | Role-gated CSV exports for rides, users, and applications with CWE-1236 formula-injection sanitization (`sanitize_csv_cell`). | **FIXED** | 7 |
| **SCALE-01** | P2 | Shared state across replicas | `dev.py` uses `InMemoryChannelLayer`; production requires `RedisChannelLayer`. | **CONFIRMED** | 8 |
| **MEDIA-01** | P2 | Media file persistence | `MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'` on local filesystem. In production, object storage (S3/R2) is recommended. | **CONFIRMED** | 8 |
